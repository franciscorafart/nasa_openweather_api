My Awesome Project

This app combines information from the Open Weather API and the NASA Api. It takes the gps position of NASA facilities and then inputs that information into the Open Weather API to get the current weather at that position.
A list with the facility's name and its temperature in fahrenheit is displayed on the html.


Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nasa Api, Open Weather API

Lessons Learned:

With this project I learned how to mix information from different API's to create applications that do custom functionality.
